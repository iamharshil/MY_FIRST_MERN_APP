# MY_FIRST_MERN_APP
- I am making an fullstack app using MERN.
- There is two sides in this project first is client side and second is server
## Client
- the client side is react freamework or library for this project.
## server
- the server side is for node express and other backend tools.
- I used some stuff like
  - body-parser for send post request
  - cors for cross origin request
  - express as framework to create routing or our application.
  - mongoose to create models of app.
  - nodemon for not doin manual reset of application.
